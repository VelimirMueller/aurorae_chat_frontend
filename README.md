# Aurorae Chat Client (still in development)

## What is Aurorae?

Aurorae is the name the llm gave itself :) It was pretty hard to force it to give itself a name but after prompt juggling a little bit it did what it needed to. However since the name is really poetic, I choose this tiny projects name shall be this one.

## How to get started?

This is just a small frontend nuxt application to handle the GPT4ALL llm. Check out this repository for the llm server which can connect to this frontend app:
https://github.com/VelimirMueller/aurorae_ws_chatbot

All to get this frontend running in dev mode (aka test this stuff) all you need to do is: 
- clone this repo
- run `yarn` or ``npm install
- run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

### Getting started

The chat client will be used in combination with the aurorae backend!
